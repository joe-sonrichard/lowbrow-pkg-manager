# lowbrow-pkg-manager
Scripts to update kubectx/kubens, kubectl, k9s, & kube-ps1 (used in bash prompt). Will perform update to latest version automatically or install latest version if not already there. Puts the programs in /usr/local/bin. Recommend symbollically linking these into the same so they are part of your path.

Wrote these because I got tired of manually copying in a single script and updating permissions.
